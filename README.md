## Notes

While building the app, I encountered some challenges, particularly with resolving Swift errors related to closures and optionals. One of the hardest parts was understanding how to pass closures between the ViewController, KeyboardController, and KeyboardCell, especially when to safely unwrap them and how to structure the callback logic.
